.. _Overview of Content Experiments:

***********************************
Overview of Content Experiments
***********************************

You use content experiments to show different course content to different groups
of students.

Also known as A/B or split tests, content experiments enable you to
research and compare the performance of students in different groups to gain
insight into the relative effectiveness of your course content.

.. _Courses with Multiple Content Experiments:

******************************************
Courses with Multiple Content Experiments
******************************************

You can run multiple content experiments in your course. You can set up each
experiment to use the same groups of students; or, you can set up each
experiment to be independent and use a different grouping.

.. important::

  If your course has multiple experiments, it is critical that you decide
  upfront if the experiments share the same groups of students or if each
  experiment has its own unique grouping. If two experiments share the same
  grouping, then any student that is in Group A for the first experiment will
  also be in Group A for the second one. If you want the experiments to be
  independent, then the experiments must use different groupings so that
  students are randomly assigned for each experiment.

To determine the available groupings of students, you :ref:`Specify Group
Configurations`. You then select which grouping to use when you :ref:`Configure the Content Experiment in Studio` or :ref:`Configure the Content Experiment in XML`.


.. _Enable Content Experiments:

****************************************
Enable Content Experiments
****************************************

To enable content experiments in your course, you add ``split_test`` to the
``advanced_modules`` policy key.

.. note::  
  A ``split_test`` is the internal edX Platform name for a content experiment.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Advanced Settings**.
#. In the Advanced Settings page, find the ``advanced_modules`` policy key.
#. In the Policy Value field, add ``"split_test"``. 
   
   Be sure to use the double quotation marks around the value, and if you use
   multiple values for the key that they are separated by commas (``,``).

#. At the bottom of the page, click **Save Changes**.

.. _Specify Group Configurations:

****************************************
Specify Group Configurations
****************************************

Before you can create content experiments, you must specify group
configurations.

A group configuration defines how many groups of students are in an experiment.
You can have any number of group configurations in your course. When you create
a content experiment, you select the group configuration to use.

For example, you may want to do one content experiment that presents either a
video or a reading assignment to your students, and another content experiment
that presents the same question using four different problem types. For the
first content experiment, you need a group configuration that divides your
students into two groups, and for the second content experiment, you need a
group configuration that divides your students into four groups.

=======================
Group Assignments
=======================

Group assignments are:

* Dynamic

  A student is assigned to a group the first time he or she views a content
  experiment that uses the group configuration.

* Random
  
  You cannot control which students are assigned to which group. 
  
* Evenly distributed
  
  The edX Platform keeps track of the size of groups and assigns new students to
  groups evenly. For example, when there are two groups in a configuration, each
  group will include 50% of the students in the course; when you have four
  groups, each group will include 25%.

* Permanent
  
  Students remain in their assigned groups regardless of how many content
  experiments you set up that use the same group configuration.

To specify group configurations, you modify the value for the
``user_partitions`` policy key in the Advanced Settings.

.. note::  
  A ``user_partitions`` is the internal edX Platform name for group
  configurations.

The value for ``user_partitions`` is a JSON collection of group configurations,
each of which defines the groups of students. 

.. note:: 
  Use names for group configurations that are meaningful. You select from the list of group configuration names when you add a content experiment. 

See the following examples for more information.

=============================================
Example: One Group Configuration
=============================================

The following is an example JSON object that defines an group configuration with two student segments.

.. code-block:: json

    "user_partitions": [{"id": 0,
                       "name": "Name of the Group Configuration",
                       "description": "Description of the group configuration.",
                       "version": 1,
                       "groups": [{"id": 0,
                                   "name": "Group 1",
                                   "version": 1},
                                  {"id": 1,
                                   "name": "Group 2",
                                   "version": 1}]
                                }
                       ]

In this example:

* The ``"id": 0`` identifies the group configuration. For XML courses, the value
  is referenced in the ``user_partition`` attribute of the ``<split_test>``
  element in the content experiment file.

* The ``groups`` array identifies the groups to which students are randomly
  assigned. For XML courses, each group ``id`` value is referenced in the
  ``group_id_to_child`` attribute of the ``<split_test>`` element.

==========================================================
Example: Multiple Group Configurations
==========================================================

The following is an example JSON object that defines two group configurations.
The first group configuration divides students into two groups, and the second
divides students into three groups.

.. code-block:: json

    "user_partitions": [{"id": 0,
                         "name": "Name of Group Configuration 1",
                         "description": "Description of Group Configuration 1.",
                         "version": 1,
                         "groups": [{"id": 0,
                                     "name": "Group 1",
                                     "version": 1},
                                    {"id": 1,
                                     "name": "Group 2",
                                     "version": 1}]}
                        {"id": 1,
                         "name": "Name of Group Configuration 2",
                         "description": "Description of Group Configuration 2.",
                         "version": 1,
                         "groups": [{"id": 0,
                                     "name": "Group 1",
                                     "version": 1},
                                    {"id": 1,
                                     "name": "Group 2",
                                     "version": 1}
                                     {"id": 2,
                                     "name": "Group 3",
                                     "version": 1}
                                     ]}
                       ]

.. note:: 
  As this example shows, each group configuration is independent.  Group IDs and
  names must be unique within a group configuration, but not across all group
  configurations in your course.

==========================================================
Modifying Group Configurations
==========================================================

After the course starts, **do not**:

* Delete group configurations.

* Change the ``id`` value of a group configuration.
  
You can add group configurations or change group configuration names at any
time.

==========================================================
Modifying Groups
==========================================================

After the course starts, **do not** change the ``id`` value of a group.
  
You can change group names at any time.

==========================================================
Removing Groups from Group Configurations
==========================================================

After a course has started, you may find that students in a specific group are
having difficulties or a poor experience. In this situation, you can remove the
group from the group configuration. Content that was specified for that
group is then no longer part of the course.

Students in the removed group are reassigned evenly to one of the other groups
in the group configuration. Any problems that these students completed in the
removed group content do not count toward the students' grades. The students
must begin the problem set again and complete all the problems in the group
content to which they've been reassigned.

Removing a group impacts the course event data. Ensure that researchers
evaluating your course results are aware of the group you removed and the
date.

==============================================
Specify Group Configurations in an XML Course 
==============================================

If you are developing your course in XML, you define group configurations in the
``policy.json`` file in the ``policies`` directory. Use the same guidelines
given above for the ``user_partitions`` policy key in Advanced Settings.

See `Define the Experiment Content in the Split Test File`_ for more
information on how the XML for the content experiment uses these settings.


.. _Configure the Content Experiment in Studio:

********************************************
Configure a Content Experiment in Studio
********************************************

After you `Enable Content Experiments`_ and `Specify Group
Configurations`_, you can configure content experiments.

You can add a content experiment in a unit or container page. In Studio, you
create and view content for all groups in the content experiment in a container
page for the experiment, as shown in `Create Content for Groups in the Content
Experiment`_.

When a student views the unit with the content experiment, she has no
indication there is a content experiment in the unit, and the content
experiment display name is not shown. She sees only the content that you
configure for the group she is assigned to. To the student, the unit with the
content experiment is no different than any other unit.


To configure a content experiment in Studio, you:

#. `Create the content experiment`_.
#. `Create content for groups in the content experiment`_.
   
After you configure a content experiment, if necessary you can `Change the Group Configuration for a Content Experiment`_.
   

===============================
Create the Content Experiment
===============================

#. In a private or draft unit page, under **Add New Component** click
   **Advanced**.

#. Select **Content Experiment**.
   
   A new content experiment is added to the unit:

   .. image:: ../Images/content_experiment_block.png
    :alt: The content experiment component in a unit page

   You can work with the content experiment as you can any other component.  See
   :ref:`Components` for more information.

#. Click **Select a Group Configuration** or **Edit** to open the content
   experiment component.

   .. image:: ../Images/content_experiment_editor.png
    :alt: The content experiment editor

#. Select a group configuration.

#. Modify the **Display Name**.  The Display Name is only used in Studio;
   students do not see this value.

#. Click **Save**.

The content experiment is displayed as a component that contains other
components. See :ref:`Components that Contain Other Components` for more
information.

You can now create content for the groups in the experiment.

=====================================================
Create Content for Groups in the Content Experiment
=====================================================
   
After you select a group configuration, in the content experiment component
click **View**.

The content experiment page that opens automatically includes a container for
each group that is defined in the group configuration you selected. For
example, if you select a group configuration that defines Group A and Group B,
you see the following page:

.. image:: ../Images/content_experiment_container.png
 :alt: The content experiment page with two groups

You add content for both groups as needed, just as you would add content to any
container page. See :ref:`Components that Contain Other Components` for more
information.

For example, you can add an HTML component and a video to Group A:

.. image:: ../Images/a_b_test_child_expanded.png
 :alt: Image of an expanded A/B test component

.. note:: 
  It is valid, and can be useful, to have no content for a group in the
  experiment.  For example, if one group has a video and another group has no
  content, you can analyze the effect of the video on student performance.


========================================================
Change the Group Configuration for a Content Experiment
========================================================

You can change the group configuration for a content experiment. When you
change the group configuration, you must add components to the new groups. You
can use the components from the previous groups, as well as create new
components.

.. warning::
  Changing the group configuration of a student-visible experiment will impact
  the experiment data.

To change the group configuration:

#. In a content experiment component, click **Edit**.

   .. image:: ../Images/content_experiment_editor_group2.png
    :alt: The content experiment editor with a group configuration selected

#. Select a different group configuration.

#. Click **Save**.

#. You must now add components to the new groups in the experiment. Click
   **View** to open the content experiment.

   You see that groups for the new configuration are empty, and any components
   that you had added to groups in the previous configuration are now moved to
   a section called **Inactive Groups**.

   .. image:: ../Images/inactive_groups.png
    :alt: Components in inactive groups

#. Drag and drop components from the Inactive Groups into the new groups as
   needed. You can also create new components in the new groups.


.. _Configure the Content Experiment in XML:

****************************************
Configure the Content Experiments in XML
****************************************

If you are developing your course in XML, you work with multiple XML files to
configure a content experiment. This section steps through the files involved in
a content experiment that shows different content to two different groups of
students.

For more information about working with your course's XML files, including
information about terminology, see the `edX XML Tutorial <http://edx.readthedocs
.org/projects/devdata/en/latest/course_data_formats/course_xml.html>`_.

=====================================================
Define the Content Experiment in the Sequential File
=====================================================

You reference a content experiment in the file for the subsection in the ``sequential`` directory. For example:

.. code-block:: xml

    ...
    <vertical url_name="name for the unit that contains the A/B test" display_name="A/B Test Unit">
        <split_test url_name="name of A/B test file in the split_test folder"/>
    </vertical>
    .....

The ``<split_test>`` element's ``url_name`` value references the name of the A/B test file in the ``split_test`` directory.


.. _Define the Experiment Content in the Split Test File:

=====================================================
Define the Experiment Content in the Split Test File
=====================================================

After you define the content experiment in the sequential file, you define the
course content you want to test in the file in the ``split_test`` directory.
This is the file referenced in the ``<split_test>`` element in the sequential
file, as shown above.

In the content experiment file, you add elements for the experiment content. For
this example, you add two ``<vertical>`` elements to compare the two different
sets of content.

.. code-block:: xml

    <split_test url_name="AB_Test.xml" display_name="A/B Test" user_partition_id="0" 
                group_id_to_child='{"0": "i4x://path-to-course/vertical/group_a", 
                                    "1": "i4x://path-to-course/vertical/group_b"}'>
        <vertical url_name="group_a" display_name="Group A">
           <html>Welcome to group A.</html>
           <video url_name="group_a_video"/>
        </vertical>
        <vertical url_name="group_b" display_name="Group B">
            <html>Welcome to group B.</html>
            <problem display_name="Checkboxes">
                <p>A checkboxes problem presents checkbox buttons for student input. 
                   Students can select more than one option presented.</p>
                <choiceresponse>
                    <checkboxgroup direction="vertical" label="Select the answer that matches">
                        <choice correct="true">correct</choice>
                        <choice correct="false">incorrect</choice>
                        <choice correct="true">correct</choice>
                    </checkboxgroup>
                </choiceresponse>
            </problem>
        </vertical>
    </split_test>


In this example:

* The ``user_partition_id`` value references the ID of the experiment defined in
  the ``policy.json`` file.

* The ``group_id_to_child`` value references the IDs of the groups defined in
  the ``policy.json`` file, and maps the group IDs to specific content.

  For example,  the value for group ``0``, ``i4x://path-to-
  course/vertical/group_a``, maps to the ``<vertical>`` element with the
  ``url_name`` equal to ``group_a``.  Therefore, students in group 0 see the
  content in that vertical.

For information about the ``policy.json`` file, see :ref:`Specify Group
Configurations`.

.. _View a Content Experiment as Course Staff:

*********************************************
View a Content Experiment as Course Staff
*********************************************

When you view a unit that contains a content experiment in the LMS in the Staff
view, you use a drop-down list to select a group. The unit page then shows the
content for that group of students.

For example, in the following page, Group 0 is selected, and the HTML component
and video that is part of Group 0 is displayed:

.. image:: ../Images/a-b-test-lms-group-0.png
 :alt: Image of a unit page with Group 0 selected

You can change the group selection to view the problem that a different group of
students sees:

.. image:: ../Images/a-b-test-lms-group-2.png
 :alt: Image of a unit page with Group 1 selected

.. note:: 
  The example course content in this chapter uses content experiment terminology
  to make the functionality clear. Typically, you would not use terminology in
  course content that would make students aware of the experiment.
