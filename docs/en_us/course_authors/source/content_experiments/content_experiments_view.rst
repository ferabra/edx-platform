View a Content Experiment as Course Staff
##########################################

When you view a unit that contains a content experiment in the LMS in the Staff
view, you use a drop-down list to select a group. The unit page then shows the
content for that group of students.

For example, in the following page, Group 0 is selected, and the HTML component
and video that is part of Group 0 is displayed:

You can change the group selection to view the problem that a different group of
students sees:

.. note:: 
  The example course content in this chapter uses content experiment
  terminology to make the functionality clear. Typically, you would not use
  terminology in course content that would make students aware of the
  experiment.
